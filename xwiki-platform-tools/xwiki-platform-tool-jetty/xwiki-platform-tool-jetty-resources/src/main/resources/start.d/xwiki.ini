--module=xwiki

## Default configuration values for XWiki

## Disable WAR scanning and hot deployments since we use static expanded WAR to speed up Jetty.
jetty.deploy.scanInterval=0
jetty.deploy.extractWars=false

## Jetty has a protection for URLs that don't respect the Servlet specification and that are considered ambiguous.
## See https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/issues/12162#issuecomment-2286747043 for an explanation.
## Since XWiki uses them, we need to configure Jetty to allow for it. See also
##   https://jetty.org/docs/jetty/10/operations-guide/modules/standard.html#server-compliance
## Thus we need to relax the following rules in addition to using RFC3986:
##   Remove AMBIGUOUS_PATH_ENCODING when https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-22422 is fixed.
##   Remove AMBIGUOUS_EMPTY_SEGMENT when https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-22428 is fixed.
##   Remove AMBIGUOUS_PATH_SEPARATOR when https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-22435 is fixed.
jetty.httpConfig.uriCompliance=RFC3986,AMBIGUOUS_PATH_ENCODING,AMBIGUOUS_EMPTY_SEGMENT,AMBIGUOUS_PATH_SEPARATOR
